PROOF OF HUMAN WORK — GOVERNANCE
─────────────────────────────────

DUAL-ENTITY MODEL
─────────────────

PoHW governance is divided between two entities:

1. PoHW FOUNDATION
   Role: Ethical stewardship and standards
   Responsibility: Protocol specification, ethics, long-term vision
   Authority: Cannot unilaterally alter protocol truth

2. PoHW LABS
   Role: Technical execution and development
   Responsibility: Implementation, infrastructure, tools
   Authority: Cannot unilaterally alter protocol specification

No single entity owns verification.
Governance actions are recorded as verifiable claims.
