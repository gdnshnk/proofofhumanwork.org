PROOF OF HUMAN WORK — ATTESTOR FRAMEWORK
─────────────────────────────────────────

OVERVIEW
────────

Attestors are entities that issue human credentials and verify
human presence. They play a crucial role in ensuring the "human"
aspect of Proof of Human Work.

FORMAL RULES FOR ATTESTORS
──────────────────────────

Who Can Issue Human Credentials:
1. Accredited institutions (universities, organizations)
2. Trusted verification providers
3. Community-validated attestors
4. Self-attestors (with reputation thresholds)

Attestation Types:
- Identity verification (KYC/AML compliant)
- Credential verification (degrees, certificates)
- Reputation-based (community validation)
- Hardware-based (biometric, hardware keys)

ATTESTOR AUDIT PROCESS
──────────────────────

Attestors must:

1. Register with PoHW Foundation
   - Submit public key
   - Provide identity information
   - Agree to audit terms

2. Maintain Public Key
   - Publish at /.well-known/public.txt
   - Rotate keys securely
   - Revoke compromised keys

3. Submit Audit Logs
   - All credential issuances
   - Revocations
   - Key rotations
   - Anomaly reports

4. Undergo Periodic Audits
   - Annual review
   - Random spot checks
   - Incident response audits

AUDIT CRITERIA
──────────────

Attestors are evaluated on:

- Accuracy of credentials issued
- Rate of false positives/negatives
- Response to revocation requests
- Key management practices
- Transparency of processes
- Compliance with privacy standards

Attestors failing audits may be:
- Suspended from issuing credentials
- Required to improve processes
- Removed from attestor registry

REVOCATION REGISTRY
───────────────────

Attestors maintain revocation lists:

- Revoked credential hashes
- Revocation reasons (optional)
- Revocation timestamps
- Public access via API

Revocation Format:
{
  "credential_hash": "0x...",
  "revoked_at": "2025-11-25T00:00:00Z",
  "reason": "compromised|expired|fraud",
  "attestor_signature": "..."
}

DID CREDENTIALS BINDING
───────────────────────

Attestors issue DID-based credentials:

Credential Format (W3C Verifiable Credentials):
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "HumanCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:pohw:attestor:example",
  "issuanceDate": "2025-11-25T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:pohw:user:example",
    "humanVerified": true,
    "verificationMethod": "in-person|remote|automated"
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2025-11-25T00:00:00Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:pohw:attestor:example#key-1",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}

BINDING TO PROOF EVENTS
────────────────────────

Human credentials bind to PoHW attestations:

1. User holds human credential from attestor
2. User creates content and generates PoHW attestation
3. Attestation includes credential reference:
   {
     "hash": "0x...",
     "signature": "...",
     "did": "did:pohw:user:example",
     "human_credential": "did:pohw:attestor:example:credential:123",
     "timestamp": "2025-11-25T00:00:00Z"
   }
4. Verifier checks credential validity
5. Verifier verifies credential binds to attestation

ATTESTOR TYPES
──────────────

Institutional Attestors:
- Universities
- Certification bodies
- Government agencies
- Professional organizations

Commercial Attestors:
- Identity verification services
- KYC providers
- Authentication platforms

Community Attestors:
- Peer validation networks
- Reputation systems
- Social proof mechanisms

Self-Attestors:
- Individual verification
- Hardware-based proofs
- Reputation thresholds required

ATTESTOR API
────────────

Standard Endpoints:

POST /attest/credential
  Issue human credential
  Auth: Attestor signature
  Response: {credential, credential_hash}

GET /verify/credential/{hash}
  Verify credential validity
  Response: {valid, issuer, issued_at, revoked}

GET /revoke/credential/{hash}
  Revoke credential
  Auth: Attestor signature
  Response: {revoked, timestamp}

GET /attest/audit
  Attestor audit logs
  Response: [{timestamp, action, credential_hash}, ...]

TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS
─────────────────────────

Attestors must publish:

- Public key (/.well-known/public.txt)
- Audit logs (publicly accessible)
- Revocation registry (queryable)
- Attestation statistics (anonymized)
- Policies and procedures

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS
──────────────────────

Attestors must:

- Minimize data collection
- Use zero-knowledge proofs where possible
- Allow credential pseudonymity
- Enable selective disclosure
- Respect user privacy rights

ATTESTOR REGISTRY
─────────────────

PoHW Foundation maintains public attestor registry:

Registry Format:
{
  "attestor_id": "did:pohw:attestor:example",
  "name": "Example Attestor",
  "public_key": "https://attestor.example/.well-known/public.txt",
  "type": "institutional|commercial|community|self",
  "status": "active|suspended|revoked",
  "registered_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "last_audit": "2025-11-01T00:00:00Z"
}

Registry Location: https://proofofhumanwork.org/attestors/registry.json
