PROOF OF HUMAN WORK — RESEARCH & FUTURE WORK
─────────────────────────────────────────────

ONGOING RESEARCH
────────────────

1. POST-QUANTUM SIGNATURES
───────────────────────────
Status: Early Research Phase
Timeline: 2026-2027

Challenge:
Current cryptographic signatures (Ed25519) may be vulnerable
to quantum computing attacks in the future.

Research Areas:
- Lattice-based signatures (Dilithium, SPHINCS+)
- Hash-based signatures
- Isogeny-based cryptography
- Migration strategies for existing proofs

Goal:
Ensure PoHW attestations remain secure beyond the quantum era
while maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure.

Publications:
- [Pending] Post-Quantum Migration Strategy
- [Pending] Performance Analysis of PQ Signatures

2. ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS
─────────────────────────
Status: Exploration Phase
Timeline: 2026-2027

Challenge:
Enable verification of human authorship without revealing
any information about the content or signer.

Research Areas:
- zk-SNARKs for authorship proofs
- zk-STARKs for verification
- Privacy-preserving attestations
- Selective disclosure mechanisms

Goal:
Enhance privacy while maintaining verifiability.

Publications:
- [Pending] ZK-Proofs for Authorship Verification
- [Pending] Privacy Analysis of PoHW

3. HUMAN PRESENCE METRICS
──────────────────────────
Status: Design Phase
Timeline: 2026

Challenge:
Detect and verify human presence in creation process
without biometric surveillance.

Research Areas:
- Behavioral analysis (typing patterns, cadence)
- Hardware attestation (secure enclaves)
- Rate limiting strategies
- Liveness detection methods

Goal:
Improve confidence in human authorship while preserving privacy.

Publications:
- [Pending] Human Presence Verification Methods
- [Pending] Privacy-Preserving Liveness Detection

4. LONG-TERM DURABILITY
───────────────────────
Status: Continuous Research
Timeline: Ongoing

Challenge:
Ensure proofs remain verifiable for 100+ years despite
technological changes and platform obsolescence.

Research Areas:
- Format migration strategies
- Protocol versioning
- Archive substrate evaluation
- Redundancy optimization

Goal:
Guarantee proof persistence across technological generations.

Publications:
- [Ongoing] Durability Assessment Report
- [Ongoing] Archive Substrate Comparison

5. PRIVACY ENHANCEMENTS
───────────────────────
Status: Active Development
Timeline: Ongoing

Research Areas:
- Anonymous credentials
- Unlinkable attestations
- Differential privacy
- Metadata minimization

Goal:
Maximize privacy while maintaining verification capability.

FUTURE WORK
───────────

Short-Term (2026):
